## :crystal_ball::star2::sparkles: About :sparkles::star2::crystal_ball:

The Filthy Wizard has been wizarding around since the <a
  href='http://www.eclipse2012.com/'>Eclipse festival</a> in November
2012 where he was deeply moved by <a
  href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPRnwEpLwc'>another wizard</a>.
Determined to learn this kind of wichcraft he dedicated much of his time
to the ðŸ”®, hoping that one day he'd also be able to express himself like
  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4SvKCsxq0o'>these</a> <a
    href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXzMRKG8fJU'>grand</a> <a
    href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSgM7-vv3tQ'>masters</a>.
  Ever since then his love for the juggle magic grew and grew and grew.
  After having learned and tought more wichcraft at the circus school in
  <a href='http://paicircusschool.com/'>Pai</a> and the circus school <a
  href='http://phareps.org/'>Phare Ponleu Selpak</a>, he started giving
workshops at the <a href='https://www.rainbowserpent.net/'>Rainbow
  Serpent Festival</a> 2014 and <a
  href='http://www.freqsofnature.de/'>Freqs Of Nature</a> 2015.

He enjoys to enchant trippers on the dancefloor and to put spells on
people.
The filthy wizard is not only filthy but also far too lazy to keep this
website up to date. So for his latest pics, vids and his upcoming gigs, please
visit his <a href='http://facebook.com/thefilthywizard'>facebook
  page</a>.
